Hello, BesVolk here! This is my first time uploading to GitHub. As the title suggests, this script gives you an unlimited trial by simply running it. Every 13 days, it resets your trial. Not only will it reset the trial, but it will also reset the bottle trial, so you'll never receive the "Bottle is expired" warning again.

Before you run it, you need to execute the following command in your terminal:

'chmod +x ~/your/own/path/Bestrial.command'
